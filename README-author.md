## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox)

### What I learned
This project gives some useful tips:
- To center a box in the middle of the page, use flexbox, then choose 'center' for both align-items and justify-content
- Use \<h> whenever possible instead of \<div> (for example see element contain the word 'Learning')
- For the author section, it can be a separate \<div>, then apply Flexbox to justify the avatar and author's name on one line
- box-shadow: \<offset x axis>, \<offset y axis>, ... to create a shadow for the container

### Continued development
I am trying to find more Flexbox applications to practice.
